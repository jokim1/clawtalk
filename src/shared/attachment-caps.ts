// Created for the PDF page-rasterization feature (plan:
// pdf-page-rasterization-plan.md, T3). Before this file the caps were
// scattered — upload caps in `attachment-extraction.ts`, native-PDF
// document caps in the talk context loader — and the webapp kept its own
// (drifted) copies. Co-locating them here lets the Worker and the
// webapp import one definition instead of re-deriving values that fall
// out of sync (Codex #11).
//
// Importable from both the Worker bundle (`../../shared/attachment-caps.js`)
// and the webapp (`../../../../src/shared/attachment-caps.js`), so the
// client rasterizer and the server validator agree on the raster caps
// with no duplication.

// ── Upload caps (re-exported from attachment-extraction.ts) ──────────
// Hard server-side limits on a single uploaded file. The webapp shows a
// friendlier client-side limit before upload; see the KNOWN DRIFT note
// at the bottom of this file.

 * Gemini's ~20 MB inline-request limit with headroom for the retained
 * `extracted_text` and request overhead. The consumer attaches pages in

//   webapp MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE       = 10 MB  (server: 25 MB)
//   webapp MAX_IMAGE_ATTACHMENT_SIZE =  5 MB  (server: 10 MB)
// The webapp is the stricter client-side pre-check. Pointing it at these
// shared constants changes the client-enforced limit (a product-facing
// behavior change), so it is intentionally deferred to the webapp lane
// rather than bundled into this backend contract change.
