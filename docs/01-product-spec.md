# ClawTalk · Product Spec

**Read me first.** This is the canonical specification of ClawTalk — the product you're building. Every concept, data structure, screen, and flow lives here. The working visual prototype (`ClawTalk Salon.html` at the repo root) is the canonical reference for *what it looks like and how it feels*. This doc tells you *what it does*.

---

## §0 · One-page overview

**ClawTalk** is a multi-agent reasoning product. Users open a **Talk** — a context-bound room — and invite a curated team of LLM agents (Strategist, Critic, Researcher, Editor, Quant) to debate a question. The agents speak in turns ("Rounds"), push back on each other, surface holes, and synthesize toward a recommendation. The output of a Talk is usually a decision *plus* a document that captures it.

### Core concepts

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Workspace** | Top-level container. Permissions root. Users belong to 1+ workspaces. |
| **Folder** | Optional, flat grouping inside a workspace. A Talk lives in 0 or 1 folder. |
| **Talk** | A multi-agent conversation about a specific question. Has rounds, a team of agents, mode (Ordered / Parallel), tools, context sources, and optional primary document. |
| **Round** | One turn of debate. Each agent in the Talk responds (Ordered) or responds in parallel (Parallel). Editor closes the round with a synthesis. |
| **Agent** | A fixed-role LLM reasoning role — Strategist, Critic, Researcher, Editor, or Quant. Each has a role template, model, persona, focus, and method. See `06-agent-system-design.md`. |
| **Team composition** | A saved roster of agents reusable across Talks. |
| **Document** | A markdown or HTML artifact with one or more tabs. It may be the primary editable document for one Talk, and may also be supporting read-only context for many Talks. |
| **Tools** | Per-Talk capabilities the agents can invoke (web search, Drive read, Gmail send, news monitor, etc.). |
| **Connectors** | Per-Talk external service bindings (Slack #channel, Drive folder, Linear project). |
| **Context** | The set of sources the room currently knows from (primary document, supporting documents, attached URLs, uploaded files, past Talks, house rules). |
| **Unfiled** | Virtual Talk list for Talks that have no folder. Not Inbox. |
| **Inbox** | Home queue of arrivals, blockers, and waiting items generated from Talk/doc/run/connector state. A Talk can be the target of an Inbox item, but is not itself an Inbox item. |
| **Archive** | Soft-delete for Talks (and optionally their docs). Recoverable. |
| **Curator** | The Home summary/copy layer over deterministic workspace state. It can polish recommendations, but it is not the source of truth for Home ranking. |

Canonical information architecture lives in `08-information-architecture.md`.
When object ownership, folder behavior, document links, or Context semantics are
ambiguous, that doc wins.

### Headline product moves (vs typical chat UIs)

1. **Multiple agents in one room, attributed by role + color + name.** The Talk thread shows who said what; agents reply to each other.
2. **Run state is first-class.** Streaming, queued, awaiting, done, failed, cancelled — visible on every agent message.
3. **Curator-driven home page.** Instead of an empty "New chat" button, Home shows a single "Do this next" recommendation, then follow-ups, then a news feed contextual to the user's Talks.
4. **Docs are first-class artifacts.** Co-edited by agents, accept/reject pending edits, browseable separately from Talks.
5. **Fixed-role agents with simple editable controls.** Users can tune model, persona, focus, and method without editing raw system prompts. Five battle-tested roles cover ~95% of needs.

## §1 · Data model changes

### 1.1 Workspaces (NEW)

A user can belong to 1+ workspaces. Workspace is the root of permissions, billing, audit, member list, default folders, provider keys.

```ts
type Workspace = {
  id: string;
  name: string;             // 'Oxbow & Co.'
  slug: string;             // 'oxbow-co' — URL-stable handle (see §11 §1)
  initials: string;         // 'OC' — UI projection (first letters of name + members.initials); not a stored column
  ownerId: string;
  plan: 'team' | 'enterprise';
  createdAt: Date;
}
type WorkspaceMember = {
  workspaceId: string;
  userId: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member' | 'guest';   // §11 §1 includes 'guest' for the account-switcher Guest workspace
}
```

**Migration.** Every existing user gets a default workspace named `<First name>'s workspace`. All existing Talks attach to it. Workspace-switcher UI required (see §4.6).

### 1.2 Folders (NEW)

Optional grouping. Flat. No nesting in v1.

```ts
type Folder = {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  title: string;
  order: number;            // user-draggable
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Constraint.** A Talk lives in **0 or 1** folder. No multi-folder, no tags. Talks not in a folder appear in Unfiled.

### 1.3 Talks (CHANGED)

- **Drop the Threads concept entirely.** Rounds handle iteration inside a single Talk.
- Add `folderId: string | null`.
- Add `sortOrder: number` — drag-orderable position within its `(folderId | Unfiled)` bucket (§11 §3). New Talks get `sortOrder = max(sort_order in bucket) + 1`; reorder via the sidebar drag handler.
- Add `createdById: UserId` — the user who created the Talk. NOT NULL, `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on `users` (§11 §3): a user can't be hard-deleted while they own Talks (leave/transfer flow handles this).
- Add `archivedAt: Date | null` (replaces delete).
- Add `team: AgentId[]` and `teamId: string | null` (snapshot + optional reference to a saved Team composition).
- Add `tools: Record<ToolId, boolean>` (per-Talk overrides; inherits workspace defaults).
- Keep `mode: 'ordered' | 'parallel'` (lowercase to match §11 §3 `talk_mode`), `roundsLimit: 1 | 2 | 3 | 5` (§11 §3 `rounds_limit` CHECK).
- **No `running` or `unread` column.** Both are derived projections returned by the API, not Talk columns (§11 §3). `running` ≡ `runs.status in ('queued','running','awaiting')` for any run in the Talk; `unread` is per-caller, derived from `talk_reads(talk_id, user_id, last_read_at)` vs newer messages.

```ts
type Talk = {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  folderId: string | null;       // null → Unfiled
  sortOrder: number;             // §11 §3 talks.sort_order — position within folder/Unfiled bucket
  title: string;
  mode: 'ordered' | 'parallel';  // matches §11 §3 talk_mode
  roundsLimit: 1 | 2 | 3 | 5;    // §11 §3 talks.rounds_limit
  team: AgentId[];
  teamId?: string;
  tools: Record<ToolId, boolean>;
  createdById: UserId;           // §11 §3 talks.created_by — NOT NULL, ON DELETE RESTRICT
  archivedAt: Date | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActivityAt: Date;
}
```

**Projected (not stored on Talk):**

- `running: boolean` — derived from `runs.status in ('queued','running','awaiting')` (§11 §3 design notes). Surface via `GET /talks/:id` and `GET /talks` projection.
- `unread: number` — derived per-user from `talk_reads.last_read_at` vs message `created_at` (§11 §3 design notes). Surface via `GET /talks` projection for the caller.

### 1.4 Threads (REMOVE)

- Every Thread becomes a Talk in migration. If a current Talk had N threads, materialize N new Talks all sharing the original Talk's intent in their title (`<Talk title> — <thread name>`), all in the same folder.
- Doc previously attached to a Thread becomes the new Talk's primary document.
- **Edge case:** if multiple threads shared a parent doc (does this happen in current code? — confirm with eng), pick the most-recent thread to own the doc; others become *unlinked* in the new Documents page.

### 1.5 Docs (CHANGED)

- `primaryTalkId: string | null` (was non-null `talkId`).
- Add `folder: string | null` (denormalized from the primary Talk while linked; falls through to its own folder if unlinked).
- Add `format: 'markdown' | 'html'`.
- Add `lastEditAt: Date`, `wordCount: number` (computed; can be derived rather than stored).
- Add tabs. Every document has at least one tab; blocks live inside tabs.
- Supporting document use inside Talks is modeled through Context, not through
  this primary link.

```ts
type Doc = {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  primaryTalkId: string | null;
  folder: string | null;
  title: string;
  format: 'markdown' | 'html';
  tabs: DocTab[];
  lastEditAt: Date;
}
type DocTab = {
  id: string;
  documentId: string;
  title: string;
  order: number;
  blocks: Block[];
  coEditorIds: AgentId[];     // §11 §5 doc_tab_coeditors — co-editors are per-tab
}
```

Co-editors are per-tab — a Draft tab can have different editors than a Comp tab. The Doc itself has no co-editors. Storage: `doc_tab_coeditors(workspace_id, tab_id, agent_id)` (§11 §5).

### 1.6 Agents (CHANGED — substantial)

Each agent is a small workspace record backed by a hidden role template and
global runtime policy. Roles are fixed for the five defaults; users can edit
name, model, persona, focus, method, and enabled state. The full architecture is
in `06-agent-system-design.md`.

```ts
type Agent = {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  roleKey: 'strategist' | 'critic' | 'researcher' | 'editor' | 'quant';
  name: string;            // user-editable display name
  handle: string;          // @strat
  initials: string;
  accent: string;
  model: string;           // current model
  defaultModel: string;    // for "reset to default"
  job: string;             // read-only role description
  persona: string;         // editable tone/voice
  focus: string;           // editable domain or topic emphasis
  method: string[];        // editable visible reasoning moves
  capabilities: string[];  // gated by Talk tools/connectors at runtime
  isCustom: boolean;       // false for the 5 ship-with-app defaults
  enabled: boolean;
}
```

**5 default agents to seed for every workspace on signup:**
- Strategist · Claude Opus
- Critic · GPT-5 Pro
- Researcher · Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Editor · Claude Sonnet
- Quant · GPT-5 Pro

Full default system prompts and methodologies are in `03-agents.md`; display
defaults, accents, and teams are in `shared/data.jsx`'s `CT_AGENTS` array. Port
canonical prompt and method text verbatim.

### 1.7 Team compositions (NEW)

Saved rosters for common Talk shapes.

```ts
type TeamComposition = {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  name: string;            // 'Pricing crew'
  description: string;
  agentIds: AgentId[];
  isDefault: boolean;      // ship-with-app teams
  runs: number;            // analytics
}
```

Seed with 3 defaults on workspace creation: Pricing crew, Research crew, Hiring crew.

### 1.8 Tools, Connectors, Context (3 distinct concepts — see §3)

**Connectors are workspace-global** (§11 §6 + roadmap #5). The `Connector` row holds the OAuth wiring for a service at the workspace level (one row per service per workspace). Per-Talk exposure is a separate `ConnectorBinding` row that selects WHICH workspace-authorized connectors are available in a given Talk. Authorization happens once on the workspace-level Connectors page; per-Talk binding happens from the Talk header.

```ts
type ToolToggle = Record<ToolId, boolean>;  // Talk-scoped + workspace default

type Connector = {                          // workspace-scoped OAuth wiring (§11 §6)
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  service: 'slack' | 'gdrive' | 'gmail' | 'linear' | 'github' | 'notion';   // §11 §6 CHECK (6 services; no telegram)
  authorized: boolean;                      // workspace-level OAuth status
  authorizedAt?: Date;
  config: Record<string, unknown>;          // service-specific config (default target, etc.)
}

type ConnectorBinding = {                   // per-Talk selection of workspace-authorized connectors (§11 §6 connector_bindings)
  connectorId: string;
  talkId: string;
  target?: string;                          // '#pricing', '/pricing-v2/', etc. — Talk-scoped override
  scope?: string[];                         // ['read','write']
  enabled: boolean;
}

type ContextSource = {                      // Talk-scoped
  id: string;
  talkId: string;
  kind: 'primary_document' | 'document' | 'url' | 'file' | 'past_talk' | 'rule' | 'news';
  name: string;
  meta: string;
}
```

## §2 · Routing & navigation

### 2.1 New routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/signin` | unchanged |
| `/home` | curator dashboard (replaces old home) |
| `/talks/:id` | Talk detail (no thread sub-path) |
| `/talks/:id/doc` | Talk + doc pane open (state-level, not separate route) |
| `/agents` | Agent roster + team compositions |
| `/agents/:id` | Single agent profile |
| `/documents` | Sortable doc table |
| `/documents/:id` | Full-bleed doc editor |
| `/settings/profile` | Account |
| `/settings/api-keys` | (NEW) |
| `/settings/agents` | Workspace-level agent management |
| `/settings/tools` | (NEW) Tools catalog |
| `/settings/connectors` | OAuth bindings |
| `/archive` | (NEW) Archived Talks |

### 2.2 Routes to delete

- `/talks/:id/threads/:threadId` and everything under it.

### 2.3 Left icon rail (5 destinations + profile)

Top to bottom:
1. **Home** — curator dashboard
2. **Talks** — sidebar list (was already there)
3. **Agents** — sparkle icon (NEW page behind it)
4. **Documents** — doc icon (was a stub)
5. **⌘K palette trigger** (visual button)
6. **Profile avatar** (replaces cog; opens profile menu)

### 2.4 Keyboard shortcuts

| Combo | Action |
|---|---|
| ⌘K | Open command palette |
| ⌘N | New Talk sheet |
| ⌘+Enter | Send composer |
| ⌘. | Cancel runs |
| ⌘J | Toggle doc pane (in Talk) |
| g h / g t / g , | Goto home / talks / settings |
| Esc | Close palette / dialog |

---

## §3 · Three abstractions to never confuse

| Concept | Answers | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | What can agents *do*? | Per-Talk popover from header + workspace catalog in Settings → Tools |
| **Connectors** | Which workspace-authorized services is this Talk *wired into*? | Per-Talk popover binds workspace connectors to this Talk; workspace-level OAuth lives on the Connectors page (§11 §6) |
| **Context** | What does the room *know right now*? | Per-Talk popover with sources (primary document, supporting documents, URLs, files, past Talks, house rules) |

All three are first-class header buttons in the Talk header — see §4.4.

---

## §4 · UI surfaces — every screen

### 4.1 Sign-in (small refresh)

- Two-pane editorial layout (already in prototype). Magic link, Google, GitHub. No change in flow vs current.

### 4.2 Home — **curator dashboard** (NEW shape)

The biggest UI change. Single wide column at 1240px max. Stack:

1. **Greeting** — "Welcome back, <name>"
2. **Curator card + 4-card stat strip side-by-side**
   - Curator card: one-sentence headline from the curator agent describing the state of the salon
   - Stats: Talks · Prompts (today / this month) · Tokens (today / this month) · Words (today / this month)
3. **Quick composer** — "Start a new room…" with template chips (Pricing review, Teardown, Weekly review, Hiring loop)
4. **"Do this next" — hero NBA card.** Single highest-priority curator-picked action with: priority badge, why-line, agent strip, primary action button, live transcript preview pane on the right when the linked Talk is streaming
5. **"Then maybe" — 3 follow-up recommendation cards**, full width each. Same shape as hero but smaller. Each carries priority badge (Decide / Improve / Tidy), why-line, talk pill, action button
6. **News for your Talks** — Perplexity-Discover-style wide cards. Headline + excerpt + source row (favicon + name + age) + colored thumbnail block on the right + "Matched: <Talk>" provenance line + Snooze / Add to context / Open actions

**Variants behind a tweak** (development only — settle on one before launch):
- `focus` — the stack above. Default.
- `split` — two-column: recs left, Activity/News tabs right.
- `feed` — narrow single column.

**Recommendations engine.** Deterministic generators read workspace state and surface actionable cards. Each cites the Talk + turn it came from (provenance is non-negotiable). Cards are dismissible and refresh on demand. The Curator can polish copy or cluster cards behind the same structured contracts. Full architecture: `07-homepage-system-design.md`.

**News feed.** Pulls live news keyed to privacy-safe topic profiles from Talks that have the **News monitor** tool enabled. Sends only topic abstracts, keywords, entities, and domains; never raw message or document content. Items decay after 3 days by default. Add-to-context is the primary action.

### 4.3 Talks sidebar (CHANGED)

Two-pane: 56px icon rail + 260px secondary list.

**Top of secondary list:**
- "Talks" header + "X active · Y streaming" subtext
- "+" button → split menu: New Talk / New folder / Import

**List body:**
- Folders (expandable, with talk count, drag-to-reorder, hover-reveal delete affordance)
- Unfiled (below folders, italic + muted gray header with count, hides entirely when empty)
- Inbox is a Home/shell queue of arrivals and waiting items, not part of the Talk folder tree
- Search input → ⌘K palette

**Profile card removed** from sidebar; the profile avatar lives in the icon rail at bottom.

### 4.4 Talk detail (CHANGED — header gets richer)

**Header right-side buttons (in order):**

1. Cancel runs (only when running)
2. **Agents · N**
3. **Tools · N** (popover with toggle switches per tool, grouped by Web / Google / Comms / Work)
4. **Context · N** (NEW popover — sources of truth for the Talk: primary document, supporting documents, URLs, files, past Talks, house rules)
5. **Connectors · N** (NEW popover — shows chips for workspace-authorized connectors that have an active `ConnectorBinding` for this Talk: Slack channel, Drive folder, Gmail label, Linear project, GitHub repo. The popover lets the user toggle existing bindings on/off and pick a per-Talk target/scope. "Manage connectors" opens the workspace-level Connectors page (Settings → Connectors) where new OAuth wiring is authorized. Connectors are authorized once per workspace; per-Talk binding selects which to expose — see §11 §6.)
6. **Document** (toggle the doc pane)
7. **⋯ More menu** — Run history · Move to folder ▸ · Rename · Duplicate · Export ▸ · Archive

**Body:** unchanged — multi-agent thread with rounds, run-state pills, agent attribution, live streaming with cursor.

### 4.5 Composer

- Address-to row with agent chips (per-Talk team) + Add agent
- Mode (Ordered / Parallel) + rounds chips
- Textarea, ⌘+Enter to send
- Footer: attach / mic / prompt library / **tool glyphs** showing what's enabled

### 4.6 Workspace switcher (REPLACES profile menu)

Asana-style two-column popover anchored to the rail's profile avatar.

- **Left column:** workspace list with avatar + name + unread dot. Current is checked. Scroll.
- **Right column:** active workspace context — user identity card, "Set out of office", links to Admin console (if owner), New workspace, Invite to workspace, Settings, Profile, Add another account, Sign out at bottom.

OOO state, custom handle, and avatar photo are deferred to a follow-up `user_profiles` extension table; the v1 schema (§11 §1) stores only `email`, `name`, `avatar_color`, and `initials`.

### 4.7 Documents (NEW page)

Dense sortable table at 1320px max width.

**Top:** workspace label + page title + 4-card stat strip (Documents · Words · Pending edits · Last activity) + filter input + "+ New document".

**Table columns** (all sortable except Primary Talk):

| Title | Fmt | Tabs | Folder | Primary Talk | Last activity | Words | ⋯ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- Click a row → open `/documents/:id` (full-bleed editor at 720px column).
- Click the **Primary Talk** pill (stop propagation) → jump into that Talk.
- Pending-edits badge in the title cell when any blocks are awaiting review.

**Full-bleed doc editor:** unlinked or primary-linked indicator in the top bar, document tabs when more than one exists, co-editor avatars in meta strip, pending-edits banner with Accept all / Reject all.

**Forge tab (post-MVP, behind feature flag).** Each document also surfaces a Forge tab for autonomous content improvement — pick a scope (whole doc / tab / target block), an objective (Audience + reference set + question, or ad-hoc), kick off an improvement run, review the gallery of scored candidates, promote a winner to a pending edit. See §5c for the full surface description.

### 4.8 Agents (NEW page)

3 sections, stacked at 1240px max width:

1. **Your team** — 3-column grid of agent cards (5 default + "Add agent" slot). Each card: avatar, name, role badge, default-model chip, job in italic, usage stats. Click → profile.
2. **Team compositions** — 3-column grid of saved teams. Each card: name, description, agent chips, runs count, Start a Talk / Edit.
3. **Discover** — placeholder for a future community marketplace.

**Agent profile page:**
- Hero: avatar, name, role badge, job, model, usage stats
- Persona (editable textarea + Reset)
- Focus (editable textarea + Reset)
- Model picker (5+ models with `default` badge)
- Method (numbered steps view + Reset)
- Raw prompt is not editable in v1; admin/dev read-only debug view only if needed
- Recent contributions across all Talks
- Disable agent for workspace at the bottom

### 4.9 Settings (RESTRUCTURED)

**Removes the top-tab strip.** Adds a 240px left rail with 5 sub-pages:

- **Profile** — display name, handle, photo, defaults
- **API keys** (NEW) — labelled tokens, reveal/copy/revoke, scope chips, "+ New key" CTA
- **AI agents** — workspace-level agent management (mostly mirrors what's on the Agents page)
- **Tools** (NEW) — workspace catalog grouped by Web / Google Workspace / Communication / Work tools. Each tool shows Connect/Configure + description
- **Connectors** — OAuth integrations (Slack, GDrive, Linear, etc.) and their bindings

Reachable from the workspace-switcher popover (no longer from a cog icon).

### 4.10 New Talk sheet (NEW)

Modal sheet, appears from ⌘N, Home "+ New Talk", or sidebar "+ → New Talk":

- Title *(optional, auto-derived from first sentence)*
- Folder *(optional, defaults to "— No folder (lands in Unfiled)")*
- Team picker (default workspace team + saved compositions + "All five agents")
- Team-preview agent chips
- Prompt *(optional — open empty room and decide inside if blank)*
- Mode (Ordered / Parallel) + Rounds (1 / 2 / 3 / 5)
- "Lands in <X>" footer summary
- Cancel / Open Talk (⌘+Enter)

### 4.11 Dialogs

**Folder delete (NEW)** — three-button confirm:
- Keep Talks (move to Unfiled) — safest, primary
- Delete folder + all Talks — destructive, gated
- Cancel

**Archive Talk with primary document (NEW)** — three-button confirm:
- Archive Talk only — keep doc (unlinked) — safest, primary
- Archive Talk AND doc together
- Cancel

If no primary document: single confirm "Archive Talk".

### 4.12 Command palette ⌘K (refresh)

- Actions: Open/close doc pane, Cancel runs, Go to Home, Settings sub-page deep links (Profile / API keys / AI agents / Tools / Connectors), Reset demo
- Jump-to: every Talk by title
- Switch model for next round
- ↑↓ navigate · ↵ select · esc close

---

## §5 · System defaults shipped with the app

Every new workspace seeds with:

- **5 default agents** (Strategist, Critic, Researcher, Editor, Quant) — full prompts and methodologies in `03-agents.md`; display seed data in `shared/data.jsx`
- **3 default team compositions** (Pricing crew, Research crew, Hiring crew)
- **The v1 tool catalog** (see §5.1) seeded with sensible enable-by-default flags (`web-search` ON, `gdrive-read` ON, `news-monitor` ON; others OFF)
- **Empty folder list** — user creates folders or leaves Talks in Unfiled

### 5.1 Tool catalog (v1)

The canonical `tool_id` vocabulary that backs `talk_tools.tool_id` (§11 §6) and the `source_scope_json.tool_ids` validation in jobs (§12 §3). The `tool_id → required connector service` map is a static code catalog, not a table (§11 §6 design notes). Capability tiers follow engineering-notes §1 (`read` = inert observation; `write` = side-effecting external mutation).

| `tool_id`        | Display name      | Connector dep (`connectors.service`) | Capability |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| `web-search`     | Web search        | `null`                               | read       |
| `web-fetch`      | Web fetch         | `null`                               | read       |
| `news-monitor`   | News monitor      | `null`                               | read       |
| `gdrive-read`    | Drive read        | `gdrive`                             | read       |
| `gdrive-write`   | Drive write       | `gdrive`                             | write      |
| `gmail-read`     | Gmail read        | `gmail`                              | read       |
| `gmail-send`     | Gmail send        | `gmail`                              | write      |
| `messaging`      | Slack post        | `slack`                              | write      |
| `linear`         | Linear create issue | `linear`                           | write      |
| `github-read`    | GitHub search     | `github`                             | read       |
| `notion-read`    | Notion read       | `notion`                             | read       |

A tool whose connector dependency is `null` runs without OAuth wiring. A tool with a connector dependency requires the workspace's `connectors` row for that service to be `authorized = true` AND the Talk's `talk_tools` row for that `tool_id` to be `enabled = true` (§11 §6 tool↔connector dependency). Cross-ref §11 §6 + §12 §3.

## §5b · Scheduled Jobs (in scope per DECISIONS D6)

A **Job** is a scheduled single-agent prompt that fires a normal run on a Talk. The user creates one from the Talk header ("Schedule a job"): pick one agent from the Talk's roster, write the prompt, set an interval/daily/weekly schedule, choose whether the run posts a message in the Talk and/or proposes a `document_edits` insert against the Talk's primary document. The scheduler claims due jobs every minute, fires a normal `conversation` run with `runs.job_id` set + `runs.trigger='scheduler'`, and Inbox surfaces `job_output_ready` / `job_blocked` items.

Full data model + scheduler semantics + UI flows live in **[12-jobs.md](./12-jobs.md)** (the canonical Jobs spec). Schema details in §11 §3 (`runs.job_id`) and §11 §8 (`jobs` table).

## §5c · Forge — autonomous content improvement (post-MVP)

**Forge** is a population-based generate-score-improve loop over a single Document. The user picks a Document (or a Tab / target block within it), an objective (Audience + reference set + question, or an ad-hoc objective), and a scope. The system kicks off an `improvement_runs` row (`run_kind='content_improvement'`) and iterates: generate candidate rewrites, score each against the SSR/Synthetical oracle (per-persona Likert + held-out evaluation), keep frontier winners, evolve from them. The run terminates on target-score / max-iterations / budget / plateau. The winner version lands as a pending `document_edits` row with `source='forge'` against the targeted tab/block — the user accepts/rejects through the normal pending-edit pane.

Internal mechanics: rewriter + critic roles are `is_system` agents (DECISIONS D3); each scoring round calls SSR/Synthetical with a stable `idempotency_key`; held-out personas persist for reproducibility.

Full PRD: **[09-autonomous-content-improvement-prd.md](./09-autonomous-content-improvement-prd.md)**. Design handoff: [10-forge-design-handoff.md](./10-forge-design-handoff.md). Schema: §11 §9 (`ssr_connections`, `forge_audiences`, `forge_personas`, `forge_reference_sets`, `forge_questions`, `forge_audience_personas`, `improvement_runs`, `improvement_run_held_out_personas`, `document_versions`). API surface: §04 §17.

Forge is **post-MVP** — it ships behind a feature flag and is not part of the v1 launch checklist. UI placement: as a Forge tab on the Document page (§4.7) for picking targets + reviewing past runs + gallery of winners, with an "Improve this with Forge" action surfaced from the document pane.

## §6 · Migration sequencing

Suggested rollout order for the eng team:

1. **Data model migration** (§1) — workspaces, folders, kill threads, doc linking
2. **Workspace switcher + profile menu** (§4.6) — touches every page
3. **Sidebar restructure** (§4.3) — folders, Unfiled, Inbox queue affordance, "+" menu, profile in rail
4. **New Talk sheet** (§4.10) — both the create flow and ⌘N hotkey
5. **Talk header buttons** (§4.4) — Context, Connectors as popovers
6. **⋯ menu + dialogs** (§4.11) — folder delete, archive flow
7. **Agents page + profile** (§4.8) — including seed agents from §5
8. **Documents page + editor** (§4.7)
9. **Settings restructure** (§4.9) — kill tab strip, add API keys + Tools panels
10. **Home dashboard** (§4.2) — curator + stats + recs + news. Highest design risk; ship behind a feature flag.
11. **Archive view** + ⌘K palette polish

Stages 1–6 are infrastructure / IA cleanup with low UI risk. 7–10 are net-new surfaces. 11 is polish.

## §7 · Open questions (need product decisions)

- **Multi-workspace billing.** Is it per-workspace or per-user? Affects API key scoping (§1.8) and connector OAuth state.
- **News monitor privacy.** Confirm the topic-summary-only contract is acceptable for enterprise users; otherwise add a workspace-level kill switch.
- **Drag-and-drop Talk filing.** Spec says drag from sidebar → folder header. Confirm desired sensitivity / drop targets — could be deferred to v1.1 if scope tight.
- **Method editor affordance.** Method is editable in v1; decide whether the UI needs an advanced warning or simple reset copy.
- **Archive retention.** How long do archived Talks live before becoming hard-delete eligible? (Default proposed: indefinite.)

## §8 · Out of scope for v1 (explicit no-go)

- Threads as a first-class concept
- Multi-folder per Talk (no tags either)
- Nested folders
- Branches / sub-conversations inside a Talk
- Multiple primary documents per Talk
- Community marketplace
- Real-time multiplayer co-editing of docs (single-user editor in v1)
