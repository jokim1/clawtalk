# ClawTalk — Scheduled Jobs

A **Job** is a saved, scheduled run: a prompt + one agent + a schedule that fires inside a Talk and lands its output as a message and/or a pending Document edit. This doc is the D6 redesign — built from the requirements the shipped feature proved out, rebuilt clean for the Workspace → Talk + Document model (no threads).

---

## 1. What jobs are for (requirements, distilled from the current build)

The shipped feature established the real requirements; the redesign keeps these and drops the rest:

- **Recurring single-agent prompt.** On a schedule, send a fixed prompt to one agent in a Talk and capture its answer. One job kind — not a general workflow engine.
- **Three schedule shapes that cover the need:** every-N-hours (UTC interval), daily (local wall-clock + time), weekly (weekdays + time). **Timezone-aware, DST-safe** for wall-clock schedules. No raw cron in v1.
- **Unattended + safe.** Job runs are **read-only by default** — no state or external mutation, web/browser tools off unless explicitly allowed. A scheduled run must not take side-effecting actions on its own.
- **Document edits are a controlled output path, not a tool escape hatch.** The interactive `apply_content_edit` tool is not registered for scheduler/manual job runs. When job document output is enabled, it must go through the explicit `emit_document_append` executor path described in §3 rather than arbitrary agent tool calls.
- **Reuse the run pipeline.** A fired job is just a row on the existing queue + executor + event stream — not a parallel execution path.
- **Self-healing lifecycle.** active / paused / blocked; a job that loses its agent goes `blocked` (not a crash loop); a failed _run_ doesn't break the job — it fires again next time.
- **Single-flight + no double-fire.** Never run two instances of the same job at once; never fire the same slot twice across scheduler ticks or queue replays.
- **Immutable history per job.** Past runs survive job lifecycle changes — archive yes, delete no (history is `runs filtered by job_id`).

**What the shipped build got wrong / carried as dead weight (removed here):** a dedicated `talk_thread` per job (threads are gone), per-user RLS (we're multi-workspace), dead `connectorIds`/`channelBindingIds` scope fields, a watermark-only claim that assumes ticks never overlap, a stuck-sweep that misses `queued` runs, prompt-as-`talk_message` (the job prompt now lives only in `jobs.prompt` and is captured per-fire via `run_prompt_snapshots`), report-as-`talk_outputs` (Documents are first-class — append goes through the unified `document_edits` path), `auto_accept` for doc appends (every job edit is review-gated, consistent with Forge's HITL principle).

---

## 2. The model

A Job belongs to a **Talk** (and its Workspace) and targets **one agent** from that Talk's roster. When it fires:

1. The scheduler claims it, freezes the Talk roster, and inserts a **run** on the Talk — a normal `conversation` run with `runs.job_id` set, `runs.trigger = 'scheduler'`, `runs.scheduled_for = <the slot timestamp>`, and `runs.prompt_snapshot_id` pointing at a fresh `run_prompt_snapshots` row that captures `jobs.prompt` verbatim at fire time.
2. **No triggering `messages` row is written.** Conversation runs from `/chat` write a user message and reference it via `runs.trigger_message_id`; scheduler/manual runs leave `trigger_message_id = NULL`. The job's prompt lives in the snapshot, not in the Talk's message stream — there is nothing for `messages.author_kind` to be (user/agent are the only values). The agent's reply is the only message produced by a job fire.
3. The run executes through the **standard queue → executor → event stream** (no special path). The executor reads the prompt from `runs.prompt_snapshot_id.prompt_text_redacted` — not from the live `jobs.prompt`, so editing the job mid-queue affects the NEXT fire, not the in-flight one.
4. The result lands per the job's **output targets** (§3).
5. Bookkeeping updates **only on terminal status** (`completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`) via terminal run handling: `last_run_at = run.finished_at`, `last_run_status`, `run_count++`, and the next slot's `next_due_at` (already advanced in the claim txn — see §5). An Inbox item is raised: `job_output_ready` on success (with `ref_id = run.id` for at-least-once dedup), `job_blocked` on dependency failure.

A job is conceptually **"a saved run that fires itself."** No threads, no separate deliverable object — it produces a run, and runs already know how to land a message and/or propose a Document edit.

### Mapping a scheduled run to the `runs` table (`11` §3)

When the scheduler inserts a run, it sets every required column per the §3 schema:

- `round = max(round) over (talk_id) at fire time + 1` (or `1` if the Talk has no rounds yet) — a scheduled fire starts its own round.
- `run_kind = 'conversation'`.
- `snapshot_group_id = <fresh group id, scheduler-generated>` — the roster freeze for this fire (a fresh group per run; the scheduler also inserts the `talk_agent_snapshots` rows for every agent in `talk_agents`).
- `agent_snapshot_id = <the targeted agent's snapshot id inside the new group>`.
- `model_id = <copied from the targeted agent's snapshot>`.
- `requested_by = jobs.created_by` (attribution-only; scheduler authorization comes from service-role + workspace scoping, not the creator's current membership).
- `trigger_message_id = NULL` (enforced by the `runs` CHECK).
- `job_id = <the firing job's id>`.
- `trigger = 'scheduler'` (or `'manual'` for run-now).
- `scheduled_for = <the slot timestamp the scheduler is firing>` (NULL for manual run-now — see §5).
- `response_group_id = <fresh>`, `sequence_index = 0`. The `response_group_id` value is `gen_random_uuid()::text` — the column is `text` (per §11 §3 length CHECK ≤ 64) so the orchestrator can mix in fragment tokens later, but for scheduler/manual runs it's a fresh uuid stringified.
- `prompt_snapshot_id = <the new run_prompt_snapshots row's id>`.

The `runs` CHECK enforces this contract: `(trigger='user') OR (trigger in ('scheduler','manual') AND job_id is not null AND trigger_message_id is null AND prompt_snapshot_id is not null)`.

The `run_prompt_snapshots` insert is required-column-mapped per `11` §4: `workspace_id = job.workspace_id`, `run_id` (the new run's id), `talk_id = job.talk_id`, `agent_snapshot_id` (the targeted snapshot), `model_id` (from snapshot), `provider = <provider selected for the model>`, `role_template_version = <target agent template version>`, `prompt_assembly_version = 1`, and `prompt_text_redacted = jobs.prompt`. The scheduler also writes `tool_manifest_json` with the frozen, source-scoped effective tool manifest plus `agentCredentialMode`; this is the executor-side enforcement point for the job's read-only `source_scope_json` and the targeted agent's credential path. Optional provenance fields (`global_policy_version`, `context_manifest_json`, `prompt_hash`) are left NULL by the scheduler; the executor or a follow-up backfill can populate them.

---

## 3. Output

The shipped feature "always posts a thread message." With threads gone and Documents first-class, a job's output is controlled by two booleans on `jobs`:

- **`emit_talk_message bool not null default true`** — the agent's answer is appended to the **Talk** as a normal `author_kind='agent'` message. The `messages` row carries `run_id` pointing at the firing run, and the firing run carries `job_id` — so the UI groups/collapses scheduled activity by joining `messages.run_id → runs.job_id`. No new `messages.job_id` column is added. (This replaces the shipped feature's per-job dedicated thread with a tag-by-join, not a separate stream.)
- **`emit_document_append bool not null default false`** — the answer is appended to the Talk's **primary Document** as a **pending `document_edits` row** (`source = 'job'`) through the unified accept path Forge uses. There is **no `auto_accept` mode** — every doc append is review-gated (consistent with §3's "no autonomous overwrite" rule and Forge's human-in-the-loop principle).

A schema CHECK requires `(emit_talk_message OR emit_document_append)` — a job must produce at least one output.

### What "primary Document" means

Primary doc per Talk is the existing `documents.primary_talk_id` reverse FK + the unique partial index at `11` §5 (0/1 primary doc per talk). This doc does **not** add a `talks.primary_document_id` column; that would create two sources of truth. The query is `SELECT * FROM documents WHERE primary_talk_id = job.talk_id`.

The primary tab inside the primary Document is the lowest-`sort_order` `doc_tabs` row for that document — `doc_tabs` has no "primary" flag.

### `document_edits` payload a job emits (cross-references `11` §5)

The executor INSERTs one `document_edits` row per successful run when `emit_document_append=true`:

- `workspace_id = job.workspace_id`, `document_id = <primary doc's id>`, `tab_id = <primary tab's id>`.
- `op = 'insert'` (the disk enum is `('insert','replace','delete')` — there is no `'insert_after'`).
- `block_id = NULL` (the op-shape check at `11` §5 requires `block_id is null` for `op='insert'`).
- `after_block_id = <last block of the primary tab by doc_blocks.sort_order, or NULL if the tab is empty>`. The check constraint allows `NULL`; the accept path materializes the block as the tab's first.
- `base_list_version = <doc_tabs.list_version at insert time>` (CAS; a concurrent reorder bumps the tab's version and marks this edit `superseded` on accept).
- `new_kind = 'p'` (the `doc_blocks.kind` enum at `11` §5 is `('h1','h2','p','li','meta','code')`).
- `new_text = <agent's reply content>`.
- `new_attrs_json = NULL`.
- `source = 'job'`.
- `proposed_by_run_id = <the run.id>`.
- `proposed_by_agent_id`: attempt INSERT with `<snapshot.source_agent_id>`. If the FK to live `agents` violates (the agent was deleted between snapshot and edit insert), retry the INSERT once with `proposed_by_agent_id = NULL`. Cheaper than `SELECT FOR KEY SHARE` on the agent row during the executor's LLM call.

### Multi-target failure: all-or-nothing

When both targets are set and the Talk has no primary Document, the job blocks (`status='blocked'`, `block_reason='no_primary_document'`) — even though `emit_talk_message` could fire on its own. This mirrors the existing "agent removed from roster" rule (one missing dependency blocks the whole job) and keeps the state machine uniform. Fail-loud beats half-broken.

Post-insert, the `document_edits.tab_id` and `after_block_id` FKs are `ON DELETE CASCADE`. If a user deletes the target tab or anchor block while a pending job edit is still pending, the row is silently cascaded out — v1 accepts this as feature (the user manually destroyed the target). Tracked in §9.

## 4. Schedule

`schedule_json` is a small discriminated union, evaluated against a stored IANA `timezone`:

- **`{ kind: 'interval', every_hours: 1..24 }`** — fixed UTC interval. Timezone-independent.
- **`{ kind: 'daily', hour: 0..23, minute: 0..59 }`** — every day at local wall-clock.
- **`{ kind: 'weekly', weekdays: [0..6], hour: 0..23, minute: 0..59 }`** — selected weekdays at local time (0 = Sunday, IANA convention).

The next fire is a precomputed `next_due_at timestamptz` watermark — not a live cron evaluator. On create / resume / after-fire, the scheduler computes the next slot by stepping wall-clock minutes through `Intl.DateTimeFormat(timezone)` and storing the result.

### Anchors

- **`interval`** anchors on `jobs.created_at`: next slot = `created_at + N * every_hours`, advancing forward until the slot is after `now`.
- **`daily`** / **`weekly`** anchor on the wall-clock time the user specified, in the job's stored timezone.

### DST policy (resolves the shipped feature's "whatever Intl does" gap)

- **Spring-forward gap** (a nonexistent local time, e.g. 02:30 on a day the clock jumps 02:00 → 03:00): the slot is skipped. The scheduler's next-slot computation advances past the gap to the next valid local-time slot.
- **Fall-back overlap** (a duplicated local time, e.g. 01:30 on a day the clock jumps 02:00 → 01:00): **the scheduler explicitly picks the FIRST UTC occurrence** and advances past both. The second UTC instant is skipped by the slot computation. (We do not rely on `unique (job_id, scheduled_for)` to dedup — the two occurrences are different UTC instants, so the index would not catch them.)

Both rules are testable in §14 with no third-party tz library required (just Intl + careful timestamp arithmetic).

### Catch-up policy

`catch_up text not null default 'skip' check (catch_up in ('skip','run_once'))` resolves the shipped feature's silent skip:

- **`skip`** _(default)_ — after downtime, the scheduler advances `next_due_at` to the next future slot. Missed slots are not re-fired.
- **`run_once`** — on the first tick where `next_due_at < now - <one slot interval>`, fire exactly once with `scheduled_for = next_due_at` (the missed slot), then advance to the next future slot. The slot-identity unique index makes re-runs impossible even if a recovery tick races a normal tick.

No multi-fire backfill: a job that missed 12 hours of slots does not produce 12 runs.

---

## 5. Scheduler semantics (robustness — the redesign's real wins)

Driven by the existing every-minute cron tick (`scheduler.ts` mechanism is kept; the implementation is reworked against the new schema). Each tick runs two independent paths:

### Path A — Process due jobs

The scheduler pages due candidate jobs where `status='active' AND archived_at is null AND next_due_at <= now`; the per-tick claim limit caps handled rows (enqueued, blocked, skipped, or catch-up-advanced), not the first raw due rows. A separate scan budget (10x the claim limit) bounds poison rows, lock races, Talk-busy rows, and other non-advancing attempts so one tick cannot walk the entire due set. Candidate selection is split into two bounded branches: unclaimed due rows use `jobs_due_unclaimed_idx`, while retry-ready backoff rows use `jobs_due_retry_ready_idx` keyed by `claimed_at`. Each candidate page reserves capacity for retry-ready rows, then orders normal pages with untouched due rows first; for `limit=1`, the page includes one retry-ready candidate plus one untouched candidate so a poison/busy retry cannot consume the only chance to reach fresh work. This prevents both failure modes: an old retry prefix cannot starve fresh untouched work, and a sustained untouched backlog cannot starve expired retry rows forever. Fresh backoff rows are skipped by an index range instead of filtered after walking an unbounded hot prefix. Busy rows are counted in TypeScript after the candidate page returns; later pages are still reached while scan budget remains. Non-advancing busy jobs and unexpected claim failures set `claimed_at=now()` as a short backoff, and the raw candidate query skips rows whose `claimed_at` is still fresh; this preserves the scan budget while preventing the same hot prefix from starving runnable jobs every tick. Per claimed job, ONE database transaction takes a `for update skip locked` row lock and runs the following ordered sub-steps; expected dependency failures block the job in-transaction, while unexpected exceptions abort the claim txn and only commit the short retry backoff:

1. **Single-flight check.** If the partial unique index `runs_one_active_per_job` (`runs(job_id) where status in ('queued','running','awaiting')`) would reject because a non-terminal run already exists, this slot is being held by an earlier run that hasn't terminated yet. Behavior depends on `catch_up`:
   - **`catch_up = 'skip'` (default):** advance `next_due_at` to the next future slot (skipping all slots that elapsed while the prior run was in flight), clear `claimed_at`, COMMIT. No new run is inserted. This prevents a long-running run from causing its own catch-up fire when it finishes (a job whose run takes 3 hours on an hourly schedule should not fire 3 missed slots once the prior run completes).
   - **`catch_up = 'run_once'`:** leave `next_due_at` unchanged, commit a short `claimed_at=now()` backoff, and retry after the prior run terminates or the backoff expires. The missed slot then fires per §4's `run_once` rule.

2. **Talk-level single-flight check.** Take a non-blocking `talks` row lock with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, then count active `runs` for the Talk. If the row lock is held by a concurrent chat/manual transaction, or an active Talk run already exists, set `claimed_at=now()` and return `busy` without inserting a run and without advancing `next_due_at` (unless step 1 already consumed a `catch_up='skip'` job-busy slot). This keeps cron ticks from waiting behind user work, delaying stuck-run sweeps, or rescanning the same busy prefix on the next tick.

3. **Fire-time dependency check.** The scheduler still holds the Talk row lock here; Talk roster/tool writers participate in the same lock so dependency validation and the source-scoped tool snapshot cannot interleave with a concurrent Talk-tool revoke. Verify:
   - The targeted agent (`jobs.agent_id`) is in `talk_agents(workspace_id, talk_id, agent_id)`.
   - The agent's `model_id` references an enabled `llm_models` row.
   - If `emit_document_append = true`: `SELECT 1 FROM documents WHERE primary_talk_id = job.talk_id` returns a row.
   - `source_scope_json.allow_web=true` has at least one enabled Talk web-tool row, and every entry in `source_scope_json.tool_ids` has a matching enabled `talk_tools(workspace_id, talk_id, tool_id, enabled=true)` row.
   - For each tool that the static `tool_id → required_service` catalog (`11` §6) says depends on a connector, the corresponding authorized `connectors` row exists in the job workspace. Google-family tool jobs require `config_json->>'compatSurface'='google_tools'`, a non-null `secret_ref`, and `config_json->>'authorizedByUserId' = jobs.created_by`; the Google credential writer materializes `gdrive` rows for Drive/Docs/Sheets scopes and `gmail` rows for Gmail scopes, backed by the same encrypted token when both services are granted. Resource-catalog rows such as `talk_resource` do not satisfy OAuth authorization. A tool that's toggled on in `talk_tools` but whose connector is unauthorized would fail at executor time with no actionable signal; checking it here turns the failure into a deterministic block. Until the greenfield Gmail runtime ships, `gmail-read` and `gmail-send` are rejected as job source-scope tools instead of being accepted and then disappearing at execution time.

   ANY failure → `UPDATE jobs SET status='blocked', block_reason=<the specific reason>, next_due_at=NULL, claimed_at=NULL` + `INSERT INTO home_inbox_items (workspace_id, type, ref_id, ...) VALUES (..., 'job_blocked', NULL, ...)` — both in the SAME transaction. COMMIT. No snapshots, no `runs` row, no queue dispatch. Path A ends for this job. The next tick will see `status='blocked'` and skip claim entirely.

   `block_reason` values: `agent_missing`, `model_disabled`, `no_primary_document`, `tool_not_enabled`, `connector_not_authorized`.

4. **Pre-generate UUIDs.** `run_id`, `snapshot_id` (for `run_prompt_snapshots`), `snapshot_group_id`, and one `agent_snapshot_id` per agent currently in the Talk's roster.
5. **Freeze roster.** Read current `talk_agents` for the Talk. For each agent, INSERT a `talk_agent_snapshots` row with the shared `snapshot_group_id`, a unique pre-generated `id`, `source_agent_id = <the live agent's id>`, and the snapshot fields per `11` §4 (role_key, model_id, temperature, persona, focus, name, handle, initials, accent — copied from the live agent). Required before the `runs` INSERT because the `runs(workspace_id, talk_id, snapshot_group_id, agent_snapshot_id)` composite FK is non-deferrable.
6. _(No explicit `SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED` needed — `runs.prompt_snapshot_id` is declared `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED` in §11 §3, so the back-edge already defers per-statement. The earlier draft of this step was a no-op and has been dropped.)_
7. **INSERT `runs`** with the full §2 mapping: `id = run_id`, `prompt_snapshot_id = snapshot_id`, `snapshot_group_id`, `agent_snapshot_id = <targeted snapshot's id>`, `trigger='scheduler'`, `scheduled_for = slot`, `requested_by = jobs.created_by`, `round = max(round)+1 over (talk_id) or 1`, `trigger_message_id = NULL`, `job_id = job.id`, `model_id = <from snapshot>`, `response_group_id = <fresh>`, `sequence_index = 0`, `status = 'queued'`.
8. **INSERT `run_prompt_snapshots`** with the required column mapping from §2 (workspace_id, run_id, talk_id, agent_snapshot_id, model_id, provider, role_template_version, prompt_assembly_version, prompt_text_redacted = `jobs.prompt`) plus `tool_manifest_json` containing the frozen job source-scope manifest and `agentCredentialMode`. Other optional provenance fields are left NULL.
9. **UPDATE `jobs`** set `next_due_at = <advance(slot)>`, `claimed_at = NULL`. Do NOT touch `last_run_status` here — bookkeeping is terminal-only (see §6).
10. **COMMIT.** The deferred FK on `runs.prompt_snapshot_id` validates now that the snapshot row exists.
11. **Dispatch to queue** (`TALK_RUN_QUEUE.send({ runId })`) OUTSIDE the job transaction as soon as that committed run returns from the claim step. This keeps already committed runs from waiting behind later candidate-page failures. If dispatch fails or the worker crashes between commit and dispatch, the existing stuck-`queued` sweep (Path B) re-dispatches the orphan run.

**No long lease / dropped-claim sweeper.** A successful claim clears `claimed_at` in the same commit that inserts the run, and a rollback leaves no committed claim behind. The only intentionally committed `claimed_at` values are short backoffs for non-advancing busy rows (`run_once` job busy, Talk busy, lock contention) and unexpected claim exceptions; those rows re-enter via the retry-ready index after the backoff window. The stuck-queued sweep re-dispatches committed runs that were not dispatched or consumed.

### Path B — Stuck-run sweep

Independent of Path A; runs every tick. Two thresholds:

- `runs.status = 'queued'` AND `runs.created_at < now - 5 min` → re-dispatch `{runId}` to `TALK_RUN_QUEUE` and leave the row `queued`. The 5-minute threshold is well past p99 queue fan-out latency; the goal is lost-delivery recovery, not slot consumption.
- `runs.status = 'running'` AND `runs.started_at < now - 1 hour` → transition to `failed`, set `error_json = '{"code":"stuck_running_swept"}'`, `finished_at = now`.

`runs.status = 'awaiting'` is NEVER swept — `awaiting` means the user (or Forge) is intentionally holding the run, not that it's stuck. Sweep doesn't apply.

Only the `running` sweep performs terminal bookkeeping in §6 and emits the failed-run event. The `queued` sweep is a pure re-dispatch and does not increment job `run_count`.

### Queue idempotency

`TALK_RUN_QUEUE` is at-least-once and can deliver concurrently. The consumer's claim is atomic:

```sql
update runs
set status = 'running', started_at = now()
where id = $1 and status = 'queued'
returning *;
```

If the returning clause yields no row, another consumer (or a stuck-sweep) already won the race. The delivery is ack'd and dropped. Serial replay after completion is also a no-op (status is `completed`/`failed`/`awaiting`, not `queued`).

The unique `(job_id, scheduled_for)` partial index protects the upstream scheduler-side race: if two scheduler ticks (same minute, slow tick + fast tick) both reach §5 step 6 for the same slot, the second INSERT hits the index and rolls back the entire txn. No double-fire, no application-side coordination.

### Failure handling layers

- **Transient run failures** retry at the queue/DLQ layer (existing infrastructure). A terminally-failed run does NOT pause or block the job — it just records `last_run_status='failed'` and fires again next slot.
- **Dependency failures** (agent gone, primary doc gone, tool disabled) flip the job to `blocked` with a `block_reason`. No auto-unblock; the user must edit the job (see §6).
- **Worker crashes** mid-claim-txn are absorbed by the txn rollback (no claim landed in the DB). Mid-run-execution crashes leave the run in `queued`/`running` until Path B sweeps it.

---

## 6. Lifecycle & surfacing

### States

- **`active`** — `next_due_at not null`. Scheduler will claim on the next tick where `next_due_at <= now`.
- **`paused`** — `next_due_at = null`. User-paused; resume recomputes `next_due_at` from `now`.
- **`blocked`** — `next_due_at = null`, `block_reason` set. Dependency missing; manual unblock required (see below).

A schema CHECK enforces the invariant: `(archived_at is not null) OR (status='active' AND next_due_at is not null) OR (status in ('paused','blocked') AND next_due_at is null)`.

### Archive (orthogonal to status)

`archived_at timestamptz` is a separate lifecycle dimension. The UI "Delete" action calls an archive endpoint that sets `archived_at = now()` and `next_due_at = NULL`. Archived rows:

- Are excluded from list endpoints via the `jobs_active` view (`WITH (security_invoker = true)` — RLS-preserving).
- Are skipped by the scheduler's claim query (archive-aware hot-path indexes: `jobs_due_unclaimed_idx` on `(next_due_at, created_at, id) include (workspace_id, talk_id) where status='active' and archived_at is null and claimed_at is null`, plus `jobs_due_retry_ready_idx` on `(claimed_at, next_due_at, created_at, id) include (workspace_id, talk_id) where status='active' and archived_at is null and claimed_at is not null`).
- Are read-only — no further edits accepted.
- Keep their run history queryable: `SELECT * FROM runs WHERE job_id = <archived_job.id>` still works because `runs.job_id` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (so hard-delete on a job with `run_count > 0` is rejected; the only path to removing run history is admin-only and out of scope here).

### Bookkeeping (terminal-only)

`last_run_at`, `last_run_status`, and `run_count` are written **only** when a run reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed` including stuck-swept failures, or `cancelled`). The scheduler does NOT touch them at run-insert time; in-flight state is observable via the `runs` table directly. Manual run-now follows the same rule.

- `last_run_at = run.finished_at`.
- `last_run_status` = `'completed'`, `'failed'`, or `'cancelled'` (no `'queued'`, no `'running'`).
- `run_count` is incremented on every terminal status — including stuck-swept failures, which ARE terminal `failed` (no special case).

### Unblock path (event-driven for v1)

When a user edits a `blocked` job (assigns a new agent, attaches a primary doc, enables the missing tool), the API handler re-runs the dependency check from §5 step 2 at save time. If all deps pass, the handler flips `status='active'`, recomputes `next_due_at = next slot from now`, and clears `block_reason`. If any check still fails, the edit succeeds but `block_reason` is updated to the new failure (so the user sees what's still missing).

Periodic scheduler-side recheck (auto-unblock when a dep heals via a different code path, e.g. an agent re-added to the Talk roster) is deferred to §9 — for v1, the user re-opening the job is the trigger.

**Note on the asymmetric blocking model.** When an agent is REMOVED from `talk_agents` mid-life, the job is NOT auto-flipped to `blocked` by a trigger on `talk_agents` delete. Instead, the scheduler's fire-time dep check (§5 step 2) catches the missing roster row on the next tick and flips the job atomically in the same txn. Result: between the `talk_agents` delete and the next tick (≤ 1 minute), the job's `status` stays `'active'` but it's effectively dormant — `next_due_at` may already be in the future. The §11 `jobs_require_agent_in_roster` trigger only fires on `INSERT` or `UPDATE OF agent_id` to the `jobs` row itself, NOT on `talk_agents` mutations. This is intentional: the runtime cost of cross-table cascading dep checks dwarfs the cost of a once-per-minute scheduler eval.

### Manual run-now

A dedicated route (`POST /api/v1/talks/{talkId}/jobs/{jobId}/run-now`) creates a `trigger='manual'` run. Semantics:

- `trigger = 'manual'`, `scheduled_for = NULL` (manual runs don't claim a slot — the scheduler doesn't fire them).
- `prompt_snapshot_id` is a fresh snapshot of the current `jobs.prompt` at run-now time (same path as scheduler, different trigger value).
- `requested_by = jobs.created_by`, same as scheduler runs, because the job creator is the execution principal whose Google tool credentials and frozen tool permissions are evaluated. The calling user must be `jobs.created_by`; workspace admins may create their own jobs in editable Talks but cannot trigger another user's credential principal.
- `round = max(round)+1 over (talk_id)`.
- `runs_one_active_per_job` enforces single-flight: if a non-terminal run already exists, the route returns 409 busy without creating a second run.
- Allowed when `status in ('active','paused')`; rejected (400) when `status = 'blocked'` (fix the dep first).
- Bookkeeping is terminal-only — manual runs increment `run_count` and update `last_run_*` via `markTalkJobRunFinished`, same as scheduler runs.

### Inbox surfacing

- **`job_output_ready`** — emitted by the queue consumer on successful run completion. `ref_id = run.id`. The unique `(workspace_id, type, ref_id)` partial index dedups at-least-once retries from the queue path.
- **`job_blocked`** — emitted by the scheduler **synchronously** in the same transaction as the `jobs.status='blocked'` transition. `ref_id = NULL`. No retry surface and no idempotency need; each new block episode produces a distinct inbox row (a job that blocks, unblocks via user edit, then blocks again writes two separate `job_blocked` rows — intentional).

### Permissions

Jobs are managed by Talk job editors: workspace owners/admins and the Talk creator can create, edit, pause, resume, and archive schedules. Manual run-now is narrower: only `jobs.created_by` can fire it, because the run executes as that creator's credential principal. RLS scopes by workspace membership like every other workspace-owned resource. The scheduler runs with service-role auth (no `auth.uid()`); accessors scope explicitly by `workspace_id`.

## 7. Schema (summary; full DDL in [11-data-model.md](./11-data-model.md))

This doc owns behavior; `11` owns the DDL. Key column-deltas from the shipped `talk_jobs` shape:

- **Add to `jobs`** (`11` §8): `workspace_id` (replaces shipped `owner_id` for tenancy), `emit_talk_message bool`, `emit_document_append bool` + CHECK at-least-one, `archived_at timestamptz`, lifecycle CHECK per §6, `jobs_active` view with `security_invoker = true`.
- **Drop from `jobs`**: `thread_id` (threads gone), `deliverable_kind`, `report_output_id`, `output_targets text[]`, `document_append_mode`, dead `connectorIds`/`channelBindingIds` keys inside `source_scope_json`.
- **Tighten `source_scope_json`** to the typed shape `{ allow_web: bool, tool_ids: text[] }`. `allow_web` validates against the Talk web-tool family and `tool_ids` validates against `talk_tools.tool_id text` at fire time (§5 Path A step 2).
- **`block_reason text`** — known values documented: `agent_missing`, `model_disabled`, `no_primary_document`, `tool_not_enabled`, `connector_not_authorized`. Free text allows future reasons without migration; the documented set is the UI contract.
- **Add to `runs`** (`11` §3): `scheduled_for timestamptz`, the CHECK invariant for scheduler/manual runs, and a partial unique `(job_id, scheduled_for) where job_id is not null and scheduled_for is not null` for slot dedup. Change `runs.job_id` FK from `on delete set null (job_id)` to `on delete restrict` so history survives job archive.
- **Add to `home_inbox_items`** (`11` §7): `ref_id uuid` + partial unique `(workspace_id, type, ref_id) where ref_id is not null`.

`run_prompt_snapshots` (`11` §4) and `documents.primary_talk_id` (`11` §5) are **reused unchanged**. There is no new `talks.primary_document_id` column — the existing reverse FK + unique partial index in `11` §5 is the source of truth.

---

## 8. Reuse vs. rewrite

- **Keep:** the every-minute cron tick, the run queue + executor + event stream, the read-only mutation lockdown for unattended runs, the timezone/DST-safe wall-clock stepping via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, single-flight via `runs_one_active_per_job`, the existing `run_prompt_snapshots` table (reused for jobs unchanged), the existing `documents.primary_talk_id` reverse FK, the existing `document_edits` accept path used by Forge.
- **Rewrite:** drop the per-job dedicated `talk_thread` (the shipped feature wrote one per job; now the run is tagged with `job_id` and that's the only grouping); replace per-user RLS with workspace-membership RLS plus narrow runtime/snapshot write policies; replace watermark-only claim with a single-transaction claim that inserts run + advances `next_due_at` + clears `claimed_at` atomically on success, while non-advancing busy/failure rows use a short `claimed_at` backoff; sweep `queued` AND `running` in the stuck-sweep; drop the trigger-message convention (no `messages` row written for the fire; prompt lives only in `runs.prompt_snapshot_id`); drop the `talk_outputs` report path; drop `auto_accept` for doc appends (always pending); narrow `source_scope_json` to the typed `{allow_web, tool_ids}` shape and validate at fire time.

---

## 9. Open items

- **Scheduler-periodic recheck for blocked-job auto-unblock.** v1 unblocks only on user edit (§6). If user telemetry shows blocked jobs sitting un-noticed because the dep healed via a different route (e.g. an agent re-added to the roster via Talk-edit UI), add a cheap periodic recheck (`SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE status='blocked' AND archived_at IS NULL LIMIT N` per tick → re-run dep check → auto-unblock if all pass).
- **Notification surface for `job_blocked`.** v1 raises an Inbox item only. Email/push is a follow-up product call.
- **Un-archive UI.** v1 has no path to revive an archived job. The data supports it (`archived_at = NULL` + recompute `next_due_at`), but the UI is deferred.
- **Post-insert tab/anchor cascade.** `document_edits.tab_id` and `after_block_id` FKs are `ON DELETE CASCADE` at `11` §5. If a user deletes the target tab or anchor block while a job-emitted edit is still pending, the row is silently cascaded out. v1 accepts this as feature (the user manually destroyed the target — surfacing a "the thing you destroyed got destroyed" notification is noise). Revisit if telemetry shows real loss.

## 14. Verification (per-feature tests — referenced from `11` §14)

1. **Slot-dedup against scheduler race.** Two scheduler ticks claim the same job concurrently for the same slot; the second `runs` INSERT hits `unique(job_id, scheduled_for)` and rolls back. One run, one slot consumed.
2. **Single-flight dedup.** Manual `run-now` while a scheduler-triggered run is `queued`; `runs_one_active_per_job` rejects the second insert; the route returns 409 busy.
3. **Queue dedup via atomic claim.** Replay an at-least-once queue message for an already-completed run; the consumer's `update runs set status='running' where id=$1 and status='queued' returning *` returns no row because status is `completed`; consumer acks and drops. Same path covers two concurrent deliveries (see #18).
4. **Single-txn safety.** Kill the worker mid-claim-txn before commit; the txn rolls back (no run row, `claimed_at` rolled back, `next_due_at` unchanged); next tick re-claims naturally.
5. **DST spring-forward gap.** A daily 02:30 job on a transition day skips the gap (next fire at 02:30 the following day).
6. **DST fall-back overlap.** A daily 01:30 job on a fall-back day fires exactly ONCE at the earlier UTC instant; at the later UTC instant the scheduler finds `next_due_at > now` and does not claim.
7. **Stuck-`queued` sweep.** Stuck queued past 5 min → re-dispatched to `TALK_RUN_QUEUE`; status remains `queued`, and job terminal bookkeeping is untouched.
8. **Fire-time dependency blocking.** Remove the agent from `talk_agents`; next tick flips the job to `blocked` with `block_reason='agent_missing'`; no run inserted.
9. **Multi-target all-or-nothing.** Unset `documents.primary_talk_id` for the Talk; next fire blocks with `block_reason='no_primary_document'`; no message posts.
10. **Manual Run-now respects single-flight.** While a non-terminal run exists, `run-now` returns 409 busy without creating a second run.
11. **Archive semantics.** Archived job excluded from `jobs_active` view and from the scheduler's claim query; past runs queryable by `job_id`; lifecycle invariant CHECK passes (`archived_at` populated → invariant satisfied regardless of status/next_due_at).
12. **Inbox idempotency for `job_output_ready`.** Replay the consumer's completion path; second `home_inbox_items` INSERT hits the unique `(workspace_id, type, ref_id)` index; no duplicate.
13. **`block_reason='no_primary_document'` specifically.** Delete the primary doc; verify the exact `block_reason` value (not just a generic block).
14. **Prompt snapshot immutability.** Insert a scheduler run with a snapshot; edit `jobs.prompt`; let the run execute; the executor reads the snapshot's `prompt_text_redacted`, not the new `jobs.prompt`.
15. **Tool-id validation.** Configure a job with `source_scope_json.allow_web=true` while web tools are disabled, or with `tool_ids` containing an entry not enabled in `talk_tools`; next fire blocks with `block_reason='tool_not_enabled'`.
16. **`runs.job_id RESTRICT`.** Attempt to hard-delete a job with `run_count > 0`; the FK rejects. The archive path succeeds (sets `archived_at`).
17. **Empty primary tab append.** Primary doc has zero blocks in its primary tab; the executor emits `document_edits` with `after_block_id=NULL`; the row commits (op-shape check allows it); the accept path materializes the block as the tab's first.
18. **Concurrent queue delivery.** Simulate two consumer workers delivering the same queued `run.id` concurrently; one consumer's atomic `update runs set status='running' where id=$1 and status='queued' returning *` returns a row; the other returns empty; only one executor proceeds.
19. **Repeat-block inbox.** Block a job (run A's dep check) → unblock via user edit → block again (run B's dep check). Two distinct `job_blocked` inbox rows exist (both with `ref_id=NULL`). The second block is NOT suppressed.
20. **Tab deleted between executor selection and edit insert.** The executor selects `tab_id`; a concurrent operation deletes that tab (the document still has ≥1 tab — the last-tab trigger at `11` §5 enforces this); the executor's `document_edits` INSERT with the now-stale `tab_id` hits the composite FK and rejects; the run transitions to `failed` with `error_json={"code":"tab_gone"}`. (If the deleted tab was the document's last tab, the trigger rejects the delete instead — this test exercises the non-last-tab case.)
21. **Anchor block deleted between selection and edit insert.** The executor selects `after_block_id = <last block>`; that block is deleted before the `document_edits` INSERT; the composite FK at `11` §5 rejects; the run transitions to `failed` with `error_json={"code":"anchor_block_gone"}`. The next scheduled fire re-selects the new last block.
22. **Connector unauthorized blocks the job.** Configure a job with `source_scope_json.tool_ids = ['gdrive-read']` and the `gdrive` connector NOT authorized (`connectors.authorized = false`); next fire blocks with `block_reason='connector_not_authorized'`; no run is inserted. Authorizing the connector + editing the job clears the block.
23. **Long-running run + `catch_up='skip'` does not catch up.** Start a scheduled run on an hourly job; let it run for 3 hours; on every tick during the run, the scheduler advances `next_due_at` to the next future slot (skipping the missed ones) instead of holding the slot. When the run finally completes, the next fire is at the next future slot, not 3 backfilled slots.
24. **Long-running run + `catch_up='run_once'` fires the missed slot.** Same setup but `catch_up='run_once'`. During the long run, ticks leave `next_due_at` unchanged and commit a short `claimed_at=now()` backoff. After the prior run terminates and terminal bookkeeping clears the claim (or the backoff expires), the next tick fires the missed slot exactly once (with `scheduled_for = the original missed slot timestamp`), then advances past it.
25. **Disabled model blocks the job.** Set the targeted agent's `model_id` to point at an `llm_models` row with `enabled=false`; next fire blocks with `block_reason='model_disabled'`; no run is inserted. Re-enabling the model (or pointing the agent at an enabled model) + editing the job clears the block.
26. **Busy/poison due rows consume scan budget without starving later due work.** Seed 10 due jobs whose Talks already have active runs or whose stored schedule is corrupted, then one later due idle job; with `limit=1`, the first scheduler claim reports 10 busy/failed rows and enqueues nothing, leaving the idle job for the next tick rather than walking past the 10x scan budget. The next tick skips the freshly deferred busy/failed rows via `claimed_at` and enqueues the idle job.
27. **Talk row lock contention is non-blocking.** Hold `FOR UPDATE` on a due job's Talk row from another transaction; the scheduler claim path returns `busy`, leaves `next_due_at` unchanged, and inserts no run.
